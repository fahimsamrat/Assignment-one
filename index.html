            <h1>My Delicious Recipe for Lunch</h1>
            <p>Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking. Drizzle with olive oil,
                then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet
                lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile set out your prosciutto on a sheet of
                plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up
                in it) on top of your cutting board. Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough
                to encompass the entire filet of beef. Using a rubber spatula cover evenly with a thin layer of
                duxelles. Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves.
                When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard.
                Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it
                up nice and tight. Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef. Roll
                it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape.
                Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape.</p>
